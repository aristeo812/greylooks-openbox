# Greylooks Openbox themes
![Screenshot: Greylooks Openbox themes](../assets/greylooks-openbox.png?raw=true "Screenshot: Greylooks Openbox themes")

## About
These themes are designed to be consistent with the corresponding [Greylooks GTK2/3](https://github.com/vbrand1984/greylooks) themes, so it's better to use them together.

Also, check my [vim syntax highlighting plugin for Openbox themes](https://github.com/vbrand1984/ob3-vim-syntax), if you're interested in creating and modifying these themes.

## Author
The author of the `themerc` files is Victor Brand. Button assets are borrowed elsewhere, mostly from the [BunsenLabs](https://github.com/BunsenLabs/bunsen-themes
), and also from the *Bear2* theme.

## Usage
Just install the theme directories into your `/usr/share/themes` (for systemwide installation) or `~/.local/share/themes` (for local install) directory.
